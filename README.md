# WeatherApp

## Used Streamlit to deploy the app
#### This Streamlit app provides a text input field for users to enter the city name and a button to get weather information. When the button is clicked, it fetches weather data using the openweathermap.org API and displays it along with a weather icon representing the current weather conditions.
## You can run this on command promt using command: streamlit run location\weatherapp.py

#### I hope you will like my work

##### This is simple and fully workable weather app using python and streamlit and apicall
